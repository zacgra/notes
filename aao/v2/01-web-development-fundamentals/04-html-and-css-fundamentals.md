## Components of HTML

- Tags - wrapped in angle brackets, usually come in pairs
- Elements - the tag(s) and if it contains content, then the content inside the tag.
- Attributes - usually name="value" pairs
  - id – gives each element a unique identifier to be selected with CSS
  - class- assigns an element to a class to be selected with CSS or JavaScript
  - title – gives a cool hover feature that displays text over an element
